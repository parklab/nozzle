Description: The Nozzle package provides an API to generate HTML reports with
    dynamic user interface elements based on JavaScript and CSS (Cascading
    Style Sheets). Nozzle was designed to facilitate summarization and rapid
    browsing of complex results in data analysis pipelines where multiple
    analyses are performed frequently on big data sets. The package can be
    applied to any project where user-friendly reports need to be created.
