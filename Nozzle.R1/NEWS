  using the setLogo( filename, location ) command.

-----------------

Release R1-0.3-0 / 20 January 2012

- Nozzle 0.3-0 no longer supports multiple reports per page and no longer generates HTML fragments.
  If an HTML fragment is requested a warning message will be printed.

- The default filename "report" has been replaced with "nozzle".

- Report usage can now be tracked with Google Analytics. A Google Analytics id can be set using
  setGoogleAnalyticsId() and retrieved using getGoogleAnalyticsId().

- Standard Nozzle reports now have a meta information section. Elements can be added with the
  addToMeta() command.
  
- Elements can now be added to the overview section with the addToOverview() command.

- Custom reports can now be created with the newCustomReport() command. Custom reports do not
  contain predefined sections.
  
- To add a meta information or a results section to a custom report newSection...() is called
  with with class="meta" or class="results", respectively.

- The print view has been updated and now includes all supplemental results as end notes.

- It is now possible to retrieve information about the Nozzle version that was used to create and
  render a report and the respective dates by calling  the getRenderer/CreatorName() and
  getRenderer/CreatorDate() functions, respectively.
  
- Store and retrieve information about script/software that generated the report using
  set/getSoftwareName() and set/getSoftwareVersion().

- It is now possible to pass a prefix and a postfix that will be applied to all URLs in the DOM that
  are relative. To add a prefix/postfix to all relative filename URLs in the report the following
  kind of query string when opening the report: nozzle.html?prefix=<prefix>&postfix=<postfix>
  Both <prefix> and <postfix> have to be URL encoded. The prefix needs to contain all required file
  path separators (usually that means it has to end with a slash). The postfix needs to begin with
  a "?". The final URLs are assembled as follows:
  <newrelativeurl> = <prefix> + <oldrelativeurl> + <postfix>
  
- A custom CSS file that overwrites the default CSS settings can be provided and read using 
  setCustomScreenCss() and getCustomScreenCss(). To change the CSS for the print layout the 
  setCustomPrintCss() and  getCustomPrintCss() may be used.
  
- The email address, subject and body of the feedback/comment/bug report message can now be set
  using setContactInformation().
  
- Export of selected elements from reports for inclusion in other reports is now possible by
  declaring an export id when the element is created with new...(). The feature is supported for
  sections, lists, paragraphs, figures and tables. Helper functions have been added to identify
  exported figures and tables and to modify the file paths of referenced images or text files.
  A list of exported elements for a report can be obtained with the getExportedElements( ... )
  function and elements can be retrieved from a report using the getExportedElement( ... ) command.
  Export of elements containing references, citations or result elements is not supported, but also
  not prevented.

- Reports now include credits for Nozzle by default, this can be turned off by setting
  "credits=FALSE" when calling writeReport().

-----------------

Release R1-0.2-99 / 18 August 2011

- A copyright owner, year, notice and URL can now be added using the setCopyright() function.

- Maintainer name, affiliation, and email address can now be added using the setMaintainer...()
  functions.

- newTable() has a new argument "significantDigits" that determines the number of significant digits
  that should be printed. Trimming will be applied only to columns of tables where
  is.numeric( columnvalues ) returns true. The default value is 2.

- Tables can now be sorted based on a user-selected column. This feature is using the 
  TableSorter JQuery plugin by Christian Bach (http://tablesorter.com/docs).

- Results that have no associated supplementary information are no longer clickable to avoid
  showing an empty result section.
  
- New layout. Supplementary information is shown in a second window on the same page that can be
  viewed at the same time as the main report.
  
- Supplementary tables and figures now use separate counters and are named Sxx, e.g. Figure S4 or
  Table S2.
  
- If a section only contains a single subsection the subsection will automatically be expanded when
  the section is expanded.
  
- The number of significant findings in a section or subsection is no longer hidden when the section
  is expanded but deemphasized to avoid distraction.

- The result section is now expanded by default to reduce the number of clicks required to get to
  the results.

-----------------

Release R1-0.2-3 / 31 March 2011

- writeReport() no longer writes a "debug fragment", even if debug=TRUE. This is necessary to
  prevent problems when a developer accidentally releases "debug code" into production.

-----------------

Release R1-0.2-2 / 23 March 2011

- Added code to convert factors into strings in data.frame objects passed into the newTable()
  function. The conversion is only performed when the report is being written.

-----------------

Release R1-0.2-0 / 05 March 2011

  Nozzle JavaScript code, unless debug=TRUE for writeReport().
  
- The jQuery library is now embedded in standalone reports.

- Multiple report fragments can now be included in a single HTML page.

- Reports now include meta information: id, version and creation date. In HTML reports this
  information is included as a comment, i.e. it is not directly visible.
  
- Added "version" (default=0) argument to newReport to indicate changes in the report structure. 
  This can be used in the future to determine whether a report has changed relative to a previous
  report.
